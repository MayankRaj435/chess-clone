Chess Clone: Real-time Multiplayer Chess Platform
Project Overview
A real-time, multiplayer chess platform developed from the ground up, drawing inspiration from established platforms like Chess.com. This project emphasizes core web technologies to deliver a responsive and interactive gaming experience, complete with a spectator mode.

Features
Real-time Multiplayer: Facilitates live chess matches between multiple concurrent players.

Custom UI/UX: Features a responsive and interactive user interface built without reliance on heavy frontend frameworks, ensuring direct control over user interactions and board rendering.

Manual Rendering Engine: Chessboard and piece movements are handled programmatically, showcasing direct manipulation of DOM elements for game state visualization.

Spectator Mode: Implements a live viewing feature, allowing third-party users to observe ongoing games.

Tech Stack
Backend
Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.

Express.js: Minimalist web framework for Node.js, handling API endpoints and routing.

Socket.io: Enables WebSocket-based, bidirectional communication for real-time game state synchronization.

Frontend
HTML: Semantic structuring of web content.

CSS: Styling and visual presentation.

JavaScript: Client-side logic, game mechanics, and dynamic UI updates.

Bootstrap: Utilized for responsive grid layouts and foundational UI components.

ReactJS: (Note: While core UI is manual, ReactJS is integrated for specific components or future modularity.)
