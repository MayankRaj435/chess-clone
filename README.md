Yo, Check Out My Chess Game!

 🎮♟️What's Up With This Project?

 ✨So, like, I built this real-time multiplayer chess game from scratch. Kinda like Chess.com, but, ya know, my version! 🚀 The whole idea was to use just the basic web stuff to make it super smooth and fun to play. Oh, and there's even a spectator mode so your buddies can watch you crush it! 


👀Cool Stuff It Does 
😎Live Chess Battles: Play against other peeps in real-time. No lag, just pure chess action! 
💥Hand-Built UI: I literally coded the whole look and feel myself, no fancy frameworks for the main bits. So, it's totally custom and responsive, looks good on your phone or computer. 
📱💻DIY Board: Yep, the chessboard and how the pieces move? All coded by hand. Shows off some serious DOM manipulation skills, if I do say so myself!
😉🤓Watch Party Mode: Your friends wanna see you play but not join in? No prob! They can just chill and watch the game live.

 🍿🥳Tech I Used (The Nitty-Gritty)

 🛠️Backend (Server Stuff) 
🖥️Node.js: This is the JavaScript engine running the show on the server side.
⚡Express.js: A super lean framework for Node.js. Used it for all the API calls and making sure everything goes where it needs to.
🛣️Socket.io: This is the magic sauce for real-time communication. It's how the game updates instantly for everyone. So clutch! 

📡💬Frontend (What You See)
 🎨HTML: Just the basic structure of the web page. 
📄CSS: Makes it look pretty, duh.
💅JavaScript: All the brainpower for the game logic, making stuff move, and talking to the server. 
🧠Bootstrap: Used it for some quick responsive layouts and basic UI elements. Saves time, ya know? 
📏ReactJS: (Okay, so even though I did a lot of manual UI, React's in there for some specific parts or maybe for later upgrades. It's kinda modular, you get it.)
